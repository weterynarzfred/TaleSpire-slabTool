# TaleSpire â€“ SlabTool

This is a simple work in progress tool for editing slabs from [TaleSpire](https://talespire.com/). Don't expect much from it.

## todo
- [ ] test a lot
- [ ] make this into a symbiote
- [ ] eyedropper
- [ ] read slap from hand
- [ ] put results into hand
- [ ] write tooltips and descriptions
- [ ] create a showcase video
- [ ] upload this thing somewhere

## done
- [x] encoding and decoding slabs
- [x] applying modifiers
- [x] nested modifiers
- [x] changing modifier order
- [x] copy to clipboard button
- [x] collapsing modifier blocks
- [x] math expression evaluation
- [x] user comments
- [x] tooltips (mostly placeholders for now)

## ideas for later
- drop to nearest surface
- filter by position
- drag and drop modifier order
- disabling modifier blocks
- saving state to localStorage and json files / templates
- terrain generation *(?)*
